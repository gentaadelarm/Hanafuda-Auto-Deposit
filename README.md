# Auto Deposit Hanafuda Bot

This project is an automated Ethereum transaction bot to perform multiple deposits to a smart contract using multiple wallets. The bot reads private keys from a text file and sends transactions according to the user-defined amount and number of repetitions.

## Features
- **Multi-wallet Support:** Reads multiple private keys from `private_keys.txt` to process transactions.
- **Customizable ETH Amount:** Users can set a custom amount of ETH or use the default value.
- **Automatic Transaction Retrying:** Automatically retries transactions if they fail.
- **Detailed Logs:** Displays each wallet's address and transaction hash for better tracking.
- **Secure Key Handling:** Only the wallet addresses are printed, private keys are kept secure in memory.

## Requirements
- Node.js installed on your machine.

  0xabc123...
  0xdef456...
  ```
### Step 4A:  Create a `tokens.json` file with the initial tokens:
